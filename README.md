This is a a Rust application to monitor internet connectivity, and if no internet available, attempt to reconnect the network.

This is currently only implemented for Windows OS, as an over-engineered method of resolving internet connectivity issues
when using my personal phone's hotspot for connectivity, and also to experiment with both Rust and GitHub Actions.
